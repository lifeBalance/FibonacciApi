# Controllers

**Web API controllers** should typically derive from [ControllerBase](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.mvc.controllerbase) rather from [Controller](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.mvc.controller):

> [!NOTE] > `Controller` derives from `ControllerBase` and adds support for **views**, so it's for handling web pages, not web API requests.

## Attribute Routing

[Attribute routing](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/mvc/controllers/routing?view=aspnetcore-8.0#attribute-routing-for-rest-apis) consists on using [C# attributes](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/advanced-topics/reflection-and-attributes/) to easily map our [controller actions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/mvc/overview/older-versions-1/controllers-and-routing/creating-an-action-cs):

- To **endpoints** in our API (URLs), for example, `[Route("api/books")]`.
- To **HTTP verbs** in our API, for example, `[HttpGet]` or `[HttpPost]`.

## Asynchronous Action

The **return type** of our controller action is a `Task<IActionResult>`:

- The [Task](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.threading.tasks.task?view=net-8.0) class is used whenever we need to perform **asynchronous operation**. Tasks can return a value, which we can specify between the `<return value>`.

- [IActionResult](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.mvc.iactionresult?view=aspnetcore-8.0) is an **interface** used to represent the result of the action method; it allows us to return various HTTP status codes. Also, we can use several [ControllerBase](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.mvc.controllerbase) **convenience methods** to return ActionResult types from an action:

  - [Ok](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.mvc.controllerbase.ok) to return a status code `200`. Note that we can wrap our **response body** in the call to this method.
  - [BadRequest](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.mvc.controllerbase.badrequest) to return `400`.
  - [NotFound](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.mvc.controllerbase.notfound) tor return `404`.

> [!NOTE]
> The [Task.FromResult](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/parallel-programming/how-to-create-pre-computed-tasks) method is used to return the result of an asynchronous operation.

## Model Binding

In our controller action we're using a mechanism known as [model binding](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/mvc/models/model-binding?view=aspnetcore-8.0) is used to automate the process of extracting the values from the **request**:

- `[FromQuery]` - Gets values from the query string.
- `[FromRoute]` - Gets values from route data.
- `[FromForm]` - Gets values from posted form fields.
- `[FromBody]` - Gets values from the request body.
- `[FromHeader]` - Gets values from HTTP headers.

In our controller, `[FromRoute]` is related to the string we used in the `[Route()]` attribute used in this action.

## Dependency Injection

[Dependency injection](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/dependency-injection?view=aspnetcore-8.0) is a software design pattern that allows us to inject dependencies into a class. ASP.NET Core has **built-in support** for this, which is achieved via [controller constructor](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/mvc/controllers/dependency-injection?view=aspnetcore-8.0). That's how I injected the `FibonacciService` into the controller (we depend on it to do our thing).

## JSON Serialization/Deserialization

Regarding this project requirement, it seems that in **ASP.NET 8**, by default:

- Controllers return **responses** in JSON format if the client requests it.
- Incoming JSON payloads in the **request body** are deserialized into C# objects automatically. I was using a `GET` request, and sending my parameters encoded in the URL and in the [query string](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_string).
